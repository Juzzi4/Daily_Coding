# Daily Coding Problems

This "app" that isnt really an app is to hold all of my coding practices. The only folder that will be changed is the Daily Coding folder and it will house all of the problems that I have completed from Hackerrank and Leetcode and any other places that I find coding problems. My goal with this "app" is to keep track of my problems and to keep practicing.

Things:

* Ruby version 2.7.1

* Normal Configuration

* Database creation (Didn't do it)

* Database initialization (Nah)

* How to run the test suite (Don't have to)

* Services (?)

* Deployment instructions (Good Luck)
